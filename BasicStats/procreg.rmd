There are two main procedures you will want to learn for
working with general linear models in SAS:
`proc reg` and `proc glm`.  In addition there are 
quite a few other procs that provide specialized analyses
of linear models.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  backtick <- "`"
  saspath <- "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
  sasopts <- "-nosplash -log 'z:' -print 'Z:' -ls 75"
```
As a first example, consider the class data set.  To predict kids
weight based on their height would look like this:
```{r, engine="sas", engine.path=saspath, engine.opts=sasopts, comment=""}
proc reg data=sashelp.class;
    model weight = height;
run;
```
