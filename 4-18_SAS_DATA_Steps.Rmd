# An Introduction to SAS Data Steps 

SAS is a procedural style programming language, like Stata and SPSS,
and in contrast to functional style languages like R, Python, and
Julia.  In SAS, most statistical analysis is carried out by
specifying a procedure (a `PROC` step).  In general, each statistical
procedure makes one or more passes through a data set.

Preparing your data for analysis is the job of the `DATA` step.  While
other statistical programming languages enable "stream of
conciousness" style data manipulation, making it very easy to
interleave data manipulations and analysis, SAS requires you to package
your data manipulation into distinct blocks of code, giving SAS a
more "structural programming" character.

At the same time, SAS DATA steps are carried out observation-by-observation
rather than variable-by-variable.  This means the sequence of
data operations is different in SAS (and SPSS) versus Stata, R, and
Python (disk-based data in concept versus memory-resident data).

## Uses of DATA Steps

Typical uses of a DATA step include:

- creating new variables
- recoding existing variables
- importing text data
- copying data
- subsetting data (extracting observations or variables)
- appending data (adding observations)
- merging data (adding variables)
- reshaping data (long versus wide)

If your task manipulates individual data values or
has instructions for each observation, it belongs in
a DATA step.

## Outline of a DATA Step

Every DATA step begins with the keyword `DATA`.  A DATA step ends
with

- a `RUN` statement
- the beginning of a new DATA or PROC step
- then end of the program file (in batch mode).

(This is also how SAS recognizes the end of any PROC step.)  Here we
will use RUN statements.  These provide visual punctuation in your code,
and also make it easier to run select blocks of code when using an
[interactive SAS environment](interfaces.html#interactive-interfaces-for-development). 

In between DATA and RUN we write statements that detail our data
manipulation.

```sas
data outputdataset;

--- data manipulation statements ---

run;
```

The DATA statement itself names an *output data set*.  Almost every DATA step creates
or replaces an entire data set. A typical DATA step names an output data set and
reads and creates data

For example if we run the code

```sas
data example;
    set sashelp.class;
    bmi = (weight/height**2)*703;
    run;
```

This creates a new data set, `example`, by reading
observations from an existing SAS data set,
`class`, and creating a new variable, `bmi`,
based on the height and weight data in the `class`
data.  The log assures us this code ran, producing
a data set with 19 observations and 6 variables.

```{saslog simple, SASproctime=FALSE}
data example;
    set sashelp.class;
    bmi = (weight/height**2)*703;
    run;
```

![example data set](data_steps/bmi.png)

### More Output Data Sets
Less commonly, you might want to read and manipulate
individual data values *without* creating a new data set.
Or you might want to create multiple output data
sets from the same input.  It is also worth
noting that there is an *default* output data set
name!

#### No Output Data

To avoid creating a new data set, specify

```sas
data _null_;
```

For example, to identify underweight teens in this
(simulated) data, and write their information to the
log (or a file)

```{saslog null, SASproctime=FALSE}
data _null_;
  set sashelp.class;
  where (weight/height**2)*703 lt 16;
	put name sex age;
run;
```

What this does *not* do is create a new data set
(or a new variable).  This can be particulary useful
when you are trying to examine outliers in your data.

#### Multiple Output Data Sets
This is especially useful when you want to create multiple
subsets of a large data set.  It is efficient because it
requires only one pass through the data.  Specify

```sas
data output1 output2 ...;
```

and use `OUTPUT` statements to direct observations to the
appropriate subset(s).

```{saslog mult, SASproctime=FALSE}
data girls boys;
  set sashelp.class;
  if sex eq "F" then output girls;
  else if sex eq "M" then output boys;
run;
```

#### Default Data Set Name
Seldom useful, but this illustrates how SAS has numerous
defaults.  Sometimes defaults are useful, sometimes they
can trip you up!  **Good style is to always explicitly name
your data sets.**

The default output data set name is `data`n, where "n"
depends on what other data sets named "data" you already
have.  Specify a bare DATA statement

```sas
data ;
```

For example

```{saslog data_n, SASproctime=FALSE}
data ;
  set sashelp.class;
run;
```


## Anatomy of a Data Step

Now that you\'ve successfully written a data step, let\'s take a closer
look at how they work. Up to this point, everything we\'ve done has been
fairly intuitive and the results have probably been pretty much what you
expected. Now we\'re going to see some surprises. Part of that is
because we\'re going to intentionally abuse SAS\--many of the odd
behaviors you\'ll see can be easily avoided just by not trying to do
things before the [set] statement. But by understanding how
SAS thinks you\'ll be able to get it to do things that are not so
obvious.

### Compile Phase

SAS executes a data step in two phases. Most commands are carried out in
one phase or the other. A few run in both. In compile phase, SAS checks
your syntax, determines all variable types, and creates the Program Data
Vector. In compile phase all relevant commands are executed exactly
once, and the execution does not depend in any way on your actual data.
The data is not even loaded into memory. This means you cannot do
something like

if x\>5 then drop x;

The [drop] command tells SAS not to write the variable x to
your output data set. But it is executed in compile phase, and at that
point SAS has no idea what the values of [x] are.

### Execute Phase

In execute phase, your data is loaded one observation at a time, the
actual work is done, and the output is written to disk. Execute phase
very much depends on the actual data, and can include conditional
execution (ifs) and loops. But keep in mind that all this is done after
compile phase is complete.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     **All Compile Phase statements are completed before Execute Phase
                                 begins,\
             *regardless of the order they\'re written in!***\

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Order of Execution

Once you reach execute phase, SAS will load one observation and execute
the entire data step before loading the next observation. So suppose you
have a data set with three observations and a data step with three
statements. The order of execution will be:

  Observation   Statement
  ------------- -----------
  1             1
  1             2
  1             3
  2             1
  2             2
  2             3
  3             1
  3             2
  3             3

### The Program Data Vector

The program data vector is SAS\'s work space. This is where an
observation is stored while it is being worked on. Think of it as a
matrix, but there is one row for each variable, and each column gives
information about that variable. This includes the variable type and
several \"flags\" that tell SAS how to process that variable. Below is
an example of what a PDV looks like. We will discuss what all the
various items mean in time.

  Name   Type      Length   Retain?   Missing Protect?   Keep?   Value
  ------ --------- -------- --------- ------------------ ------- -------
  x      Numeric   8        Yes       No                 Yes     1
  z      Numeric   8        No        No                 Yes     .

SAS creates the PDV during compile phase and sets all but the value at
that time. During execute phase the only attribute that can be changed
is the value\--it wouldn\'t make sense to have [x] be
numeric for some observations and character for others, for example.

You should also note that the PDV only has room for one observation.
When observation two is loaded, SAS has no idea what is contained in
observation one or observation three. This used to be one of SAS\'s
strengths, as it required very little memory to work with even the
largest data sets. But memory is plentiful now, and you\'ll see that it
takes some work to get around this in some situations. If your plans
involve lots of calculations across observations (individuals living in
households, for example) you should consider learning to use proc sql
(not covered in this article) or switching to Stata.

### Implicit Code

A key to understanding SAS is understanding what it adds to your data
steps. This implicit code is needed to make your explicit code work, but
you need to make sure it is doing what you want.

Suppose you write a data step that says:

data second;\
[set \'first\';]\
run;

This simply creates a temporary copy ([second]) of the
permanent data set [first]. I\'ll describe what SAS actually
does in pseudo-code:

***Top of Data Step***\
[Set each variable to missing if its Retain flag is set to
No.]\
***Set Statement***\
[If there are no more observations in [first.sas7bdat], go
to ***End of Data Step***]\
[Else read an observation]\
***End of Code***\
[Write each variable to temporary data set [second] if its
Keep flag is set to Yes]\
[Go to ***Top of Data Step***]\
***End of Data Step***

Note the importance of the [set] statement. The
[set] statement is one of the few commands that run in both
compile and execute phase. In compile phase, it tells SAS to prepare a
place in the PDV for all the variables in the input data set. In execute
phase, it is the set command that actually loads an observation. If you
put any execute-phase code before the [set] statement, when
that code executes all the variables will either be missing or left over
from the previous observation. Finally, it is the [set]
statement that determines when the data set ends. This means that code
before the [set] statement will be executed one last time
after the final observation has been written to the output data set.

### The Retain Flag

The Retain flag is used to prevent a variable from being reset to
missing at the top of the data step. This makes it a vital tool for
passing information from one observation to another. Note however, that
information can only move forward (without using tricks that are beyond
the scope of this article). With careful use of the Retain flag, it is
possible to store information from observation one until observation two
can use it. But observation three will still be unknown.

The Retain flag is automatically set to yes for all variables that come
from the input data set. For new variables, you can set it using the
[retain] statement.

retain x;

will set the Retain flag to yes for the variable [x]. You
can also set an initial value:

retain x 5;

This will set the Retain flag to yes and set [the value of
x] to 5 in compile phase before any observations are read.

To see how this all works, go back to your program and change it to the
following:

data out1;\
[a=x;]\
[b=x+z;]\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[z=x+y;]\
run;

proc print data=out1;\
run;

Save it, run it, and look at the output. You\'re probably in for a
surprise:

    Obs    a     x    b     z     y

      1    .     1    .    11    10
      2    1     2    .    11     9
      3    2     3    .    11     8
      4    3     4    .    11     7
      5    4     5    .    11     6
      6    5     6    .    11     5
      7    6     7    .    11     4
      8    7     8    .    11     3
      9    8     9    .    11     2
     10    9    10    .    11     1

At first glance, this looks crazy. But it\'s perfectly logical\--if you
think like SAS. Take a moment and try to figure it out yourself before
reading further.

The variable [a] is set equal to [x], but before
the [set] statement. Thus the first time it executes, no
observation has been loaded and [x] is missing. After
setting [a] to missing, SAS proceeds to the
[set] statement and loads the first observation, so
[x] is 1. When the other code is complete, SAS then goes to
the top of the data set. Because x came from the input data set, its
Retain flag is set to yes and [x] stays 1. So when SAS sees
[a=x;] for the second time, [a] gets 1. Only
after [a] is set does the second observation
([x=2]) get loaded. This pattern continues for all the rest
of the observations, so [a] is always one observation
behind.

Next consider [b]. The first time through the data step,
both [x] and [z] are missing, so [b]
is missing. Then we hit the [set] statement and the first
observation is loaded ([x=1]), and then z is calculated
([z=11]). But then we go to the top of the data step. The
Retain flag for [x] is set to yes automatically, but
[z] does not come from the input data set and thus its
Retain flag is set to no. So when we come to [b=x+z;]
[x] is still 1, but [z] is missing. As a result
[b] is also set to missing (anything + missing = missing),
and this continues for all observations.

Note the order in which the variables are listed:
[a],[x],[b],[z],[y].
This is not random\--it is the order in which SAS encounters the
variables in the code. In compile phase, when SAS sees
[a=x;] it realizes it will need variables a and x, and
creates entries for them in the PDV. It then adds [b] and
[z] when it sees [b=x+z;]. Occasionally it is
useful to have the variables in a certain order. You can do it by
controlling the order in which SAS sees them. For example, if we wanted
to make the order
[a],[b],[x],[y],[z],
you could add

retain a b x y z;

as the first line of the data step. Of course in this case that would
change the results for [b] (how?). It\'s more common that it
wouldn\'t change anything, but there are alternative commands that
really won\'t change anything.

### The Sum Operator

SAS gives you an easy shortcut for sums; the sum operator. The syntax is
simply:

[var]+[expression];

Note that there is no equals sign, which may bother you if you have a
programming background (though C++ and Java both have something kind of
similar). The expression will be added to the variable, almost as if you
had written

[var]=[var]+[expression];

But if you use the sum operator, SAS will do several things for you
automatically. First, it will set the Retain flag for the variable to
yes, and give it an initial value of zero.

It will also set the Missing Protect flag to yes. Normally if you add a
missing value to anything the result is a missing value. But if the
Missing Protect flag is set to yes, missing values are treated like
zeroes. You\'ll have to decide if this is appropriate for your analysis
or not. But without this protection, a single missing value will make
the sum missing for all subsequent observations.

To see the sum operator in action, create a new file using your text
editor, and save it as [example2.sas]:

data out2;\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[count1+1;]\
[count2=count2+1;]\
[retain count3 0;]\
[count3=count3+1;]\
[count4+junk;]\
[retain count5 0;]\
[count5=count5+junk;]\
run;

[proc print data=out2;\
run;]\

Run it, and you should get the following output:

    Obs     x     y    count1    count2    count3    count4    junk    count5

      1     1    10       1         .         1         0        .        .  
      2     2     9       2         .         2         0        .        .  
      3     3     8       3         .         3         0        .        .  
      4     4     7       4         .         4         0        .        .  
      5     5     6       5         .         5         0        .        .  
      6     6     5       6         .         6         0        .        .  
      7     7     4       7         .         7         0        .        .  
      8     8     3       8         .         8         0        .        .  
      9     9     2       9         .         9         0        .        .  
     10    10     1      10         .        10         0        .        .  

We\'ve added five new counting variables, that add up things in various
ways. Let\'s look at each in turn.

[count1] illustrates the normal sum operator. For each
observation we add one to [count1], so it ends up containing
the observation number.

[count2] looks like it should do the exact same thing.
However, we did not use the sum operator. This means that the Retain
flag is not set to yes, nor is the variable initialized. As a result we
are adding 1 to a missing value every time, so the result is always
missing.

[count3] is retained and properly initialized, so in this
case it does work the same as the sum operator.

[count4] and [count5] illustrate the effect of
the Missing Protect flag. The variable [junk] is never set
to anything, so it is always missing. Thus even though
[count5] is retained and initialized just like
[count3], when we add [junk] to it it becomes
missing. Because [count4] uses the sum operator, its Missing
Protect flag is set to yes. Thus when junk is added to it, it is treated
as zero, and [count4] is unchanged. Thus it never changes
from its initial value of zero (which is also set automatically just
because [count4] uses the sum operator).

### The Keep Flag

The Keep flag determines whether or not a variable is written to the
output data set. It is not removed from the PDV. This means you can
continue to use that variable for the duration of the current data step.
However if the Keep flag is set to no, that variable will not appear in
your output.

The Keep flag can be set using either the [keep] command or
the [drop] command.

keep x;

will set the Keep flag for [x] to yes, and the Keep flag for
all other variables to no. [x] will be the only variable in
your output data set.

drop y z;

will set the Keep flag for [y] and [z] to no,
and leave the Keep flag for all other variables unchanged.
[y] and [z] will not appear in the output data
set. Note that it is just fine if [drop y z;] is followed by
[x=y+z;] since [y] and [z] are still
in the PDV and can still be used.

Here\'s a puzzle for you. Consider the following data step:

data out;\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[keep count1;]\
[count1+1;]\
run;

Assuming [count1] does not exist until it is defined here,
does it make any difference at all what data set is used for input?
Could we replace [\'ex1\'] with
[\'2000USCensus\'] and get the exact same results in
[out]?

[count1] is the only variable that will be written to
[second]. Since we\'re assuming it is a new variable all the
variables from the input data set will be gone. So the values of the
variables from the input data set don\'t matter. However, it is the
[set] statement that determines when the data step is
finished. So [out] will have the same number of observations
as the input data set. Presumably a data set of US census information
will have a lot more observations than the ten we have in our simple
little example data set, so [out] would in fact look very
different. Incidentally, this is why [example2.sas]
continued to load [ex1] even though we didn\'t care about
the variables it contained: we needed some observations so we could
observe the behavior of the [count] variables.

### Subsetting If

[Keep] and [drop] allow you to control what
variables (columns) make it into your output data set. A subsetting if
allows you to control what observations (rows) make it. The syntax is
simply

if [condition];

The implicit \"then\" is usually described as \"keep this observation\"
and if the condition is not true then delete it. However, this is
somewhat deceptive. What really happens is that if the condition is
true, the data step proceeds as usual. If it is not, then SAS jumps back
to the top of the data step without writing any output. However, all
code before the subsetting if is still executed. Consider the following
example:

data out3;\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[count1+1;]\
[if x\>5;]\
[count2+1;]\
run;

[proc print data=out3;\
run;]\

Put this in its own file ([example3.sas]) and run it. The
output should look like this:

    Obs     x    y    count1    count2

     1      6    5       6         1  
     2      7    4       7         2  
     3      8    3       8         3  
     4      9    2       9         4  
     5     10    1      10         5  

So why are [count1] and [count2] so different?
Both are initialized to zero because they use the sum operator. Then the
first observation is loaded (x=1), and [count1] is increased
by 1. However, because [x] is not greater than 5, when SAS
hits the subsetting if this observation is not written to the output
data set, nor is [count2] increased by one. Instead SAS
jumps back to the start of the data step, loading the second observation
and increasing [count1] by one again. This continues until
the sixth observation ([x=6]) is loaded and
[count1] increased to 6. At this point [x] is
greater than 5 and SAS proceeds through the subsetting if. Now finally
[count2] increases from zero to one, and for the first time
the observation is written to the output data set. As the data step
proceeds, [count1] and [count2] both continue to
increase, but [count1] is always five ahead.

### Where

The [where] statement provides a more efficient method of
subsetting. If you change [if x\>5;] to [where
x\>5;] then SAS will check to see if x\>5 in the next
observation before it even loads it. If it is not, SAS moves on to the
next observation.

Change [if x\>5;] to [where x\>5;] in your
program and then run it again. This time [count1] is the
same as [count2]. That\'s because SAS didn\'t even load the
first five observations and thus didn\'t increment [count1].

If you need to get some information out of the observations you drop
before you drop them, a subsetting [if] will allow you to do
that. Otherwise [where] is usually the better method.

### \_N\_

While we\'re talking about counters, SAS has one that is built in.
[\_N\_] is an internal variable that starts at one and is
increased every time SAS goes back to the top of the data step. Thus it
is almost the observation number. But consider what happens after the
last observation is written: SAS goes back to the top of the data step
and \_N\_ is incremented again, so now it is one greater than the number
of observations. SAS stops only when it reaches the set statement and
realizes there are no more variables.

## Program Flow

We\'ve already seen how a subsetting if interrupts the flow of your
program, sending SAS back to the top of the data step if a condition is
not met. But you can also control the flow explicitly, executing some of
your code many times or not at all, depending on your data.

### If

The basic syntax for [if] is just

if [condition] then [statement];

The [statement] will be executed only if the
[condition] is true. For example

if x=5 then y=1;

Note that the equals sign has two distinct meanings here. In the first
case it is a test: is [x] equal to 5? In the second case it
is a command: make [y ]equal to 1. Make sure you know which
one you mean to use. There are several other logical operators:

  Symbol                                   Meaning
  ---------------------------------------- --------------
  =                                        equal
  [\^= ]or[ \~=]   not equal
  \>                                       greater than
  \<                                       less than
  &                                        logical AND
  [\| ]or[ !]      logical OR

If you\'re used to other languages, note that [!=] cannot be
used for not equals. The logical AND and OR connect two conditions.
Logical AND means the result is true only if both conditions are true;
logical OR means the result is true if either condition is true. For
example, suppose x=5 and y=3.

if x=5 & y=2

will be false\--the first condition is true but not the second.

if x=5 \| y=2

will be true.

Often logical OR is used to see if a variable takes on one of several
values, but SAS has an easier alternative:

if x in(1,3,5)

will be true if [x] is 1, 3, or 5. You could do the same
thing with

if x=1 \| x=3 \| x=5

but this is longer to type and harder to read.

### Else

An [else] tells SAS what to do if the condition is not true.
The syntax is:

if [condition] then [statement1];\
else [statement2];

If the [condition] is true, then [statement1]
will execute. If it is not, [statement2] will execute. Note
that [statement2] can also include an if, which allows you
to deal with many possibilities. For example,

if x\>0 then positive=1;\
else if x\<0 then negative=1;\
else zero=1;

Here [positive], [negative], and
[zero] are indicator variables, which will contain a one if
x is respectively positive, negative, or zero.

### Do Groups

But what if you want to do more than one thing if a condition is true?
Fortunately you don\'t have to write the same if over and over. Instead
you can group statements such that SAS will treat them like one. A do
group begins with [do;] and ends with [end;].

if x\>5 then do;\
[y=3;]\
[z=1;]\
end;

Note the indentation: SAS doesn\'t care but it will make it much easier
for you to figure out what is going on.

### Do Loops

Do loops (for loops in most other languages) actually have very little
to do with do groups, other than using one. They are an easy way to do
something a certain number of times. The syntax is

do [var]=[i] to [j];\
[{do stuff}]\
end;

[var] is just a utility variable called a loop counter. It
keeps track of how many times you\'ve done the loop. Normally it has no
use whatsoever once the loop is done, but remember to drop it unless you
really want it to be in the output data set. [i] and
[j] are integers, with [i]\<[j] if
you want the loop to actually do anything.

When SAS first encounters your do loop, it sets the loop counter to
[i]. It then executes commands until it hits the
corresponding [end;]. When it sees that, it increases the
loop counter by one. If at that point the counter is greater than
[j], it proceeds. If not, it goes back to the
[do] statement.

Try the following ([example4.sas]):

data out4;\
[do i=1 to 10;]\
[[x=i;]]\
[end;]\
run;

proc print data=out4;\
run;

Note that there is no input data set, and no [set]
statement. That means the code is executed just once, except for what\'s
in the loop. That also means just one observation is written to the
output. But why is [i] different from [x]?

    Obs     i     x
     1     11    10

Recall that the loop counter is incremented at the end of the loop, and
then SAS decides whether to go back or not. So when [i] was
10, SAS repeated the loop, and set [x] to 10. Then
[i] was increased to 11, SAS realized the loop was done, and
it proceeded to the end of the data step. That\'s when the current
values of [x] and [i] were written to the
output.

### Output

Normally SAS inserts an implicit command at the end of the data step to
write the current tables of the PDV to the output data set. However, you
can take control of this process with the [output] command.
The output command tells SAS to write the PDV to the output data set
immediately. Furthermore, if you include an explicit output command, SAS
will not add an implicit one to the end of the data step. This allows
you to write an observation more than once, or not at all.

As an example, add an output statement inside the do loop of your last
program ([example5.sas]):

data out5;\
[do i=1 to 10;]\
[[x=i;]]\
[[output;]]\
[end;]\
run;

proc print data=out5;\
run;

We now have ten separate observations. Furthermore, the final value of
[i] changed. Why?

    Obs     i     x

      1     1     1
      2     2     2
      3     3     3
      4     4     4
      5     5     5
      6     6     6
      7     7     7
      8     8     8
      9     9     9
     10    10    10

Previously, when [i] was set to 11 the do loop ended, SAS
reached the end of the data step, and the observation was written. Now
that you have included an explicit [output] statement, the
implicit output at the end of the data step is removed. [i]
is still set to 11, but we never see it because it only happens
after the last [output] statement.

### Arrays

One of the most common uses for do loops is to do the same thing to many
variables. However, to do this we need a way to refer to a collection of
variables by number. SAS does this by defining arrays. An array in SAS
is different from any other programming language. It is not used to
store information; it is not a variable. Rather, it is another way of
referring to existing variables\--a way that is highly convenient for do
loops.

To define an array, the syntax is

array [name]([n]) [variable1]
[variable2]\...;

For example:

array vars(3) x y z;

Once we\'ve done this, [vars(1)] is just another name for
[x], [vars(2)] for [y] and
[vars(3)] for [z].

Let\'s double the values of all the variables in our data set
([example6.sas]).

proc print data=\'ex1\';\
run;

data out6;\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[array vars(2) x y;]\
[do i=1 to 2;]\
[[vars(i)=vars(i)\*2;]]\
[end;]\
run;

proc print data=out6;\
run;

Now in this case setting up the array and the do loop was a good bit
more work than just writing

x=x\*2;\
y=y\*2;

But suppose you had a hundred variables\--then the advantage would be
obvious.

Note that array definitions only last for the duration of the data step.
But they are easy to copy and paste from one data step to another.

### Variable Lists

On the other hand, writing out the names of all one hundred variables
would get pretty tedious. Fortunately SAS has some shortcuts for writing
out lists of variables. They can be used in more than just array
definitions (you can use them in [retain],
[drop], and [keep] statements for example), but
they are particularly useful in array definitions.

If you have variables with some sort of stem and then a number
([var1], [var2], [var3], etc.) you
can use a number list. Just put a dash between the first and last
variables ([var1-var3]).

You can always use a position list. Suppose you had variables
[a], [b], [c], [x],
[y], [z], in that order. You could refer to them
all by putting a double dash between [a] and [z]
([a\--z]). Just remember that the variables must be in the
proper order for this to work\--recall our discussion of how SAS decides
what order to put variables in.

There are also several special purpose lists you can designate by name.
These include [\_all\_] for all variables,
[\_numeric\_] for all numeric variables, and
[\_character\_] for all character variables.

Finally you can use a wildcard. The colon ([:]) will match
anything, or nothing. For example, [var:] would include
[var], [var1], [var2],
[variable], [variety], and anything else that
starts with [var].

These kinds of shortcuts can sometimes make it less than obvious just
how many elements your array has. In your array definition you can just
put an asterisk ([\*]) in the parenthesis and SAS will give
the array as many elements as there are variables in your list. You can
also use the [dim() ]function to find out how many elements
an array has, for example to figure out how many times a do loop needs
to execute. Try the following changes ([example7.sas]\--just
save [example6.sas] with the new file name and then make the
changes):

proc print data=\'ex1\';\
run;

data out7;\
[set \'ex1\';]\
[array vars(\*) \_all\_;]\
[do i=1 to dim(vars);]\
[[vars(i)=vars(i)\*2;]]\
[end;]\
run;

[proc print data=out7;\
run;]\

Note that [i] was not doubled. Why?

    Obs     x     y    i

      1     2    20    3
      2     4    18    3
      3     6    16    3
      4     8    14    3
      5    10    12    3
      6    12    10    3
      7    14     8    3
      8    16     6    3
      9    18     4    3
     10    20     2    3

Remember that SAS works through the code line by line in compile phase.
So when it saw the array definition, it had not yet seen any reference
to the variable [i]. Thus [i] was not yet in the
PDV, and [\_all\_] consisted solely of [x ]and
[y]. This can be a good thing\--it can be really confusing
if you\'re trying to loop over an array that contains the loop counter.

A puzzle for you: if [i] had been defined before the array
(say, with a [retain] statement), what value would it have
in the output data set?

The answer is 7. Can you see why?

### By, First, and Last

Often data sets have some sort of group structure. For example,
individuals may live in households. To be honest, SAS data steps don\'t
handle this kind of situation very well, because they only have one
observation in memory at a time. If you are planning to work with this
kind of data, you should consider learning either proc sql or Stata. But
the tools SAS does have are important to learn.

The first step is to identify what makes up a group. You do this with
the [by] statement. The syntax is just:

by [variable1] [variable2]\...;

For example, if [hhid] was a household id,

by hhid;

This allows you to use first and last. These are conditions that will be
true if SAS currently has the first or last observation of the group in
memory. The syntax is [first.][variable] or
[last.][variable], as in

if first.hhid then [(do something)];\
else if last.hhid then [(do something else)];

There is one additional requirement for using [by], and that
is the data must be sorted by the [by] variables. Which
leads us to\...

### Proc Sort

Proc sort is a utility proc that sorts data. The syntax is

proc sort data=[input] out=[output];\
[by [variables];]\
run;

where [input] is an existing data set and
[output] is a data set that will be created. For example,

proc sort data=first out=second;\
[by x;]\
run;

If you list more than one variable, the data set will first be sorted by
the first variable in the list, then ties will be sorted by the second
variable, etc. If you need to sort in descending order, just add the
word [descending] before that variable. For example:

proc sort data=first out=second;\
[by x descending y;]\
run;

## Example: Working with Households

We\'re now going to do an example. As we work through it, try to think
of your own solutions, but don\'t be discouraged if you nothing workable
comes to mind. Learning to think like SAS is important but it takes
time. As you\'ll see later there\'s an easier way to do this task using
a proc, but it\'s important to know how to do such things yourself for
those times when you need to calculate something that isn\'t built into
a proc.

Start by taking a look at the tables of [ex2.sas7bdat]. You
should have no problem writing a program that will allow you to do so,
so try before you read on.

The solution, of course, is just a proc print:

proc print data=\'ex2\';\
run;

We have here a data set of individuals, each living in households. You
are given the income of each individual, but your task is to create a
new variable containing the total household income of each household.
Before proceeding, try to describe how to do this in English. The trick
is to remember that SAS only knows about one observation at a time.

The basic procedure will be to add up the income from each individual.
But this means the calculation won\'t be complete until we reach the
last individual in each household. So the second step will be to reverse
the order of the observations and then take that correct value of
household income from the last observation and copy it to all the other
observations (remember information can only move forwards).

As a first try at the first part, try the following.

data step1;\
[set \'ex2\';]\
[hhinc+income;]\
run;

proc print data=step1;\
run;

What is wrong? What\'s needed to fix it?

    Obs    hhid    id    income     hhinc

      1      1      1     30000     30000
      2      1      2     45000     75000
      3      1      3         0     75000
      4      2      4     60000    135000
      5      2      5     55000    190000
      6      3      6     42000    232000
      7      4      7     90000    322000
      8      4      8     15000    337000
      9      4      9         0    337000
     10      5     10     25000    362000

The problem is that the [hhinc] variable is ending up with a
running sum of all incomes, not just the incomes of the people in each
household. What we need is a way to \"start over\" when we start a new
household. Try to write it before reading the following:

data step1;\
[set \'ex2\';]\
[by hhid;]\
[if first.hhid then hhinc=0;]\
[hhinc+income;]\
run;

proc print data=step1;\
run;

The output will be:

    Obs    hhid    id    income     hhinc

      1      1      1     30000     30000
      2      1      2     45000     75000
      3      1      3         0     75000
      4      2      4     60000     60000
      5      2      5     55000    115000
      6      3      6     42000     42000
      7      4      7     90000     90000
      8      4      8     15000    105000
      9      4      9         0    105000
     10      5     10     25000     25000

So now you have the correct household income, but only for the last
individual in the household (actually, the last person with a non-zero
income and everyone after them). Now you need to make that last
observation first. Obviously this will require proc sort, but try to
write it yourself.

proc sort data=step1 out=step2;\
[by hhid descending hhinc;]\
run;

This sort doesn\'t necessarily reverse the order of observations in each
household, but it does guarantee that someone with the correct household
income will be first in each household. Now you just need to give every
person in each household the same value for household income as the
first person in that household. The easiest way involves creating a new
variable and then dropping our current [hhinc]. See if you
can take it from there before proceeding.

data final;\
[set step2;]\
[by hhid;]\
[retain hhincome;]\
[if first.hhid then hhincome=hhinc;]\
[drop hhinc;]\
run;

proc print data=final;\
run;

Note that [hhincome] is retained. This means it is only
changed when we explicitly change it. When we reach the first
observation in a new household, we set [hhincome] to their
[hhinc] variable (recall that this value is correct for the
first observation in each household). For the second and subsequent
observations, [hhincome] simply stays the same. Add a proc
print so you can see the results and you\'re done.

    Obs    hhid    id    income    hhincome

      1      1      2     45000      75000 
      2      1      3         0      75000 
      3      1      1     30000      75000 
      4      2      5     55000     115000 
      5      2      4     60000     115000 
      6      3      6     42000      42000 
      7      4      8     15000     105000 
      8      4      9         0     105000 
      9      4      7     90000     105000 
     10      5     10     25000      25000 

For an alternative way of doing the same task, see the example under
merging.

## Example: Reshaping Data

Any data that has groups and subgroups (for example, individuals living
in households) can be presented in two forms. In the long form, each
subgroup has its own observation\--the data set used in the last example
was in this form. In the wide form, each group is just one observation,
and there is a separate set of variables for each subgroup. The dataset
[whh.sas7bdat] is in this form. For whatever reason the wide
form seems to be more common with data sources. However, the long form
is usually more useful for analysis. So it is a common task to have to
reshape data from the wide form to the long. We\'ll also learn how to
convert long to wide, just in case.

In the long form you will have just one age and one sex variable for
each individual, not the four age and sex variables per observation you
have now (note that sex is stored as an indicator variable). You will
also be creating multiple observations from each currently existing
observation. This calls for putting an output statement inside a do
loop. Since you\'re using a do loop, you will have a loop counter
variable telling you which observation you\'re writing\--you can also
use this to pick which age and sex to write by putting them all in an
array. Consider this as a first try:

data long;\
[set \'ex3\';]\
[keep hhinc hhid age sex;]\
[array ages(4) age1-age4;]\
[array sexes(4) sex1-sex4;]\
[do i=1 to 4;]\
[[age=ages(i);]]\
[[sex=sexes(i);]]\
[[output;]]\
[end;]\
run;

proc print data=long;\
run;

Here [i] is your loop counter, but it also tells you which
observation you\'re writing. When [i] is one, you are
writing the first individual in the household, and thus set
[age] to [age1] and [sex] to
[sex1]. When [i] is 2, we are working with the
second individual and use [age2] and [sex2],
etc. There\'s just one problem with the result. Can you see it?

    Obs    HHID    HHINC    age    sex

      1      1     50000     30     0 
      2      1     50000     28     1 
      3      1     50000      3     0 
      4      1     50000      .     . 
      5      2     80000     45     0 
      6      2     80000     47     1 
      7      2     80000     12     1 
      8      2     80000      8     0 
      9      3     40000     25     1 
     10      3     40000      .     . 
     11      3     40000      .     . 
     12      3     40000      .     . 

Because every observation must have all variables, our original data has
ages and sexes defined for four people in each household. However, they
are all needed only in household two. Household one has three members,
and household three has just one. But our program creates four
observations per household regardless.

The solution is to add an if condition before the output statement. We
will only output an observation if either [sex] or
[age] is non-missing. If both variables are missing, we
assume the person does not actually exist. This is not an entirely
innocuous assumption. It does not distinguish between a household with
less than four people and a household containing a person whose sex and
age really weren\'t determined. However, it is usually unavoidable. In
the wide form, the number of variables is determined by the largest
group, so in real data sets there may be room for twenty or more
individuals in each household. Leaving them all in your analysis is
probably not an option.

The appropriate modification is:

data long;\
[set \'ex3\';]\
[keep hhinc hhid age sex;]\
[array ages(4) age1-age4;]\
[array sexes(4) sex1-sex4;]\
[do i=1 to 4;]\
[[age=ages(i);]]\
[[sex=sexes(i);]]\
[[if age\~=. \| sex\~=. output;]]\
[end;]\
run;

proc print data=long;\
run;

And the result will be:

    Obs    HHID    HHINC    age    sex

     1       1     50000     30     0 
     2       1     50000     28     1 
     3       1     50000      3     0 
     4       2     80000     45     0 
     5       2     80000     47     1 
     6       2     80000     12     1 
     7       2     80000      8     0 
     8       3     40000     25     1 

Now let\'s convert it back. This time, you need to combine multiple
observations into one observation. But you won\'t need to write a loop:
SAS is already looping over observations. What you will need to do is
keep track of which observation in the household you are working with,
and then write the result when you are all done. \"All done\" means
you\'ve read the last observation, so that\'s a job for [by]
and [last]. Keeping track of which observation you\'re on is
a job for a loop counter, so we\'ll create one for ourselves even though
SAS is doing the looping. Add the following to your code.

data wide;\
[set long;]\
[array ages(4) age1-age4;]\
[array sexes(4) sex1-sex4;]\
[by hhid;]\
[if first.hhid then n=1;]\
[ages(n)=age;]\
[sexes(n)=sex;]\
[if last.hhid then output;]\
[n+1;]\
[drop n sex age;]\
run;

proc print data=wide;\
run;

Try running this. What\'s wrong?

    Obs    HHID    HHINC    age1    age2    age3    age4    sex1    sex2    sex3    sex4

     1       1     50000      .       .       3       .       .       .       0       . 
     2       2     80000      .       .       .       8       .       .       .       0 
     3       3     40000     25       .       .       .       1       .       .       . 

The last person in each household is being stored properly, but the
others are missing. That\'s because the age and sex variables are not
retained. Thus SAS resets them to missing every time it loads a new
observation. So when we get to the last observation in each household,
all the previous information is gone. The solution is just to add a

Try running it again. Now what\'s wrong?

The problem is household three. It should have just one individual
living in it, but our data set lists four. The other three came from
household two. Retain doesn\'t do anything special as a result of
[by] groups, so when we moved from household two to
household three, all the age and sex variables stayed the same.
[age1] and [sex1] were then overwritten by the
actual person living in household three, but the other variables were
not.

We need to tell SAS to set all the ages and sexes to missing when we are
ready to move on to a new household. This is easy to do:

data wide;\
[set long;]\
[retain age1-age4 sex1-sex4;]\
[array ages(4) age1-age4;]\
[array sexes(4) sex1-sex4;]\
[by hhid;]\
[if first.hhid then n=1;]\
[ages(n)=age;]\
[sexes(n)=sex;]\
[if last.hhid then do;]\
[[output;]]\
[[do i=1 to 4;]]\
[[[ages(i)=.;]]]\
[[[sexes(i)=.;]]]\
[[end;]]\
[end;]\
[n+1;]\
[drop i n sex age;]\
run;

proc print data=wide;\
run;

Note how the indentation makes it easy to see the logic of the program,
even though we have several different layers. Your output should be:

    Obs    HHID    HHINC    age1    age2    age3    age4    sex1    sex2    sex3    sex4

     1       1     50000     30      28       3       .       0       1       0       . 
     2       2     80000     45      47      12       8       0       1       1       0 
     3       3     40000     25       .       .       .       1       .       .       . 

## Data Set Options

SAS can do some work with an input data set before your data step ever
sees it, or with an output data set after your data step is done with
it. You control this by setting various data set options. These are
statements in parenthesis immediately following the data set
name\--either the name of the output data set in the [data]
statement, or the name of the input data [set] in the set
statement. They can also be used in procs. For example:

proc print data=bigDataSet (obs=20);\
run;

This will print just the first 20 observations from
[bigDataSet], so you can look them over.

Some of the more commonly used options include:

(obs=[n)]

This causes SAS to stop processing after n observations. This is
extremely useful in testing your code. You can have SAS run your program
on just the first 100 observations to make sure it works, or have SAS
print just some of the observations so you can look at them, as in the
above example.

(where=([condition]))

This has the same function as the [where] statement.
Observations which do not meet the condition are never even loaded. The
differences are where it goes (right after the data set as opposed to
its own line) and the equals sign.

(drop=([variables]))

(keep=([variables]))

These are similar to the [keep] and [drop]
commands inside a data step (again note the equals sign), but if applied
to the input data set the variables not selected are never loaded.
Again, it as if they didn\'t exist.

(rename=(oldName1=newName1 oldName2=newName2))

This option allows you to rename variables, and if applied to input the
name is changed before the data is even loaded.

If you want to apply more than one option, they go in the same set of
parentheses:

proc print data=bigDataSet (obs=20 where=(x\>10));\
run;

Note that your code will be run more quickly if it has to work with less
data. If you will be cutting down the number of observations or
variables at some point, doing it with using data set options on the
input data set where possible will be the most efficient.

## Combining Data Sets

Combining data sets is a very common task in SAS. Often the data come in
pieces or from multiple sources, or you may generate a data set you need
to combine with the original data. SAS has a couple different tools for
combining data sets, depending on how they need to go together.

### Appending Data Sets

![Appending two data sets is like stacking them on top of each
other.](screenshots/4-18/4-18_1.png)

If you just need to add the observations from two data sets together,
this is called appending. For example if you had one data set of
domestic cars and another of foreign cars, you could append them to make
a single data set of all cars. Normally you would only do this if the
two data sets have the same (or almost the same) variables. If one data
set has a variable that the second data set doesn\'t, all the
observations from the second data set will be assigned missing values
for that variable.

Appending data sets if very simple in SAS: simply list all the data sets
you wish to append in the set statement. Consider the following:

data combined;\
[set set1 set2 set3;]\
run;

The output data set, [combined], will contain all the
observations from [set1], then all the observations from
[set2], and finally all the observations from
[set3]. It will have all the variables used by any of these
data sets, and if any of the input data sets are missing a variable it
will be missing in that data set\'s observations.

### Merging

![Merging two data sets is like setting them side by
side.](screenshots/4-18/4-18_2.png)

If two data sets have the same (or almost the same) observations but
different variables, you combine them with a merge. For example, if one
data set had car names and prices, and another had car names, weights,
and fuel efficiency, you could merge them to create a singe data set
with all the data available. Note that if a car appeared in one data set
but not the other, it will have missing values for all the variables
from the other data set.

Note that in my example, name appeared in both data sets. This is
important because it will be the identifier used to link observations.
Assuming every car has a unique name, this is an example of a one-to-one
merge. But suppose you had one data set of individuals including the
state they live in, and another data set containing welfare benefit
levels for each state. You could perform a merge that creates a data set
of individuals and the welfare benefits available to them, but each
state would be merged with many individuals. This is an example of a
one-to-many merge. Logically it is also possible to have many-to-many
merges, but these are more likely to be the result of logical errors or
problems with the data sets.

The syntax for a merge is the same no matter what kind it is:

data combined;\
[merge set1 set2;]\
[by matchvar;]\
run;

Here [matchvar] is the variable that will be used to link
the observations. In our first example, it would be the name of the car;
in the second the name of the state. It is possible to link by multiple
variables. In that case observations will be merged only if they have
the same values for all the match variables.

Sometimes it\'s important to know whether an observation was
successfully matched between the two data sets. For example, you may
want to get rid of observations that are incomplete (be careful though,
as this could bias your analysis). You can tell SAS to create a new
variable indicating whether a data set contributed to an observation
with the [in] data set option. The syntax is just
[in=variable], but  the variable thus created is only
temporary. It\'s gone even before you can use it in data set options for
the output data set. So if you need to keep those values, store them in
another variable. Here\'s another version of the last example, but one
which only keeps observations that exist in both data sets:

data combined (drop=in1 in2 where=(in1=1 & in2=1));\
[merge set1 (in=temp1) set2 (in=temp2);]\
[by matchvar;]\
[in1=temp1;]\
[in2=temp2; ]\
run;

## Example: Households Again

An alternative way to find household incomes is let proc means do all
the hard work and then merge in the results. See the [SAS
documentation](http://support.sas.com/onlinedoc/912/getDoc/proc.hlp/a000146728.htm)
for more details about proc means. We will use it to create a data set
containing just the household incomes for each household:

proc means data=\'ex2\';\
[by hhid;]\
[var income;]\
[output out=households sum(income)=hhincome;]\
run;

proc print data=households;\
run;

The households data set will contain the following:

    Obs    hhid    _TYPE_    _FREQ_    hhincome

     1       1        0         3        75000 
     2       2        0         2       115000 
     3       3        0         1        42000 
     4       4        0         3       105000 
     5       5        0         1        25000 

We have a couple extra variables we don\'t need, but we\'ll get rid of
them later. Now all we need to do is merge the household income data
with the original data set. Note that this is a one to many merge (one
household matches with many individuals) and that our match variable is
[hhid]. We\'ll also get rid of the extra variables proc
means created.

data hhincomes;\
[merge \'ex2\' households (drop=\_TYPE\_ \_FREQ\_);]\
[by hhid;]\
run;

proc print data=hhincomes;\
run;

You\'ll notice that this method is shorter and simpler than what you did
before\--which is what you would expect since you used a pre-written
tool (proc means) rather than doing all the work yourself. The previous
example was mostly intended as a learning experience, though if you
needed to calculate a function not covered by proc means you might have
to do something similar.

## Using your Log File

In the unlikely event it hasn\'t happened already, be aware that quite
often your programs won\'t run properly the first time. Or the second.
Or the third. Debugging often takes as long as writing the program
itself, or longer. In these cases your best hope for understanding what
SAS thinks your program means (as opposed to what you think it means) is
to look closely at your log file.

SAS puts a lot of information in your log file\--sometimes too much. It
can be tempting to skip looking at it and jump straight to the output
(the [.lst] file). Resist this temptation. An error in your
code can make your output meaningless. One common scenario is that the
program failed before reaching the commands that generate output and as
a result the [.lst] file you\'re reading is from a previous,
presumably even more buggy, run. Your text editor can help you: do a
search for the word ERROR. If it doesn\'t exist, at least you know your
program ran all the way through (though you don\'t know for sure it did
what you intended). If it does, you\'ll know where things went wrong.

If you do find a syntax error, some of the most common causes are
simple.

### Missing Semicolon

This is undoubtedly the most common error. The problem here is that SAS
will attempt to interpret the next command as part of the last command.
What makes it particularly confusing is that SAS will blame the error on
the command after the missing semicolon, so you may miss the problem
with the line above. Here\'s an example from some code we\'ve used
previously:

keep hhinc hhid age sex\
array ages(4) age1-age4;

Note that there should be a semicolon at the end of the first line. Here
is an excerpt from the log:

    4          data long;
    5           set 'whh';
    6           keep hhinc hhid age sex
    7           array ages(4) age1-age4;
                         _
                         22
                         76
    ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: a name, -, :, ;, _ALL_, _CHARACTER_, _CHAR_, _NUMERIC_.  

    ERROR 76-322: Syntax error, statement will be ignored.

    8           array sexes(4) sex1-sex4;
    9           do i=1 to 4;
    10              age=ages(i);
                     ____
                     68
    ERROR 68-185: The function AGES is unknown, or cannot be accessed.

Note the line underneath the word [ages(4)], with two
numbers underneath that. That indicates where SAS ran into a problem,
and the numbers direct you to the corresponding ERROR messages. SAS
still thinks it\'s working on a [keep] statement, so it\'s
looking for variables or lists of variables. [array] is a
perfectly good variable name (which is unfortunate in a some ways) but
[ages(4)] fails because of the parentheses.

The second error message arises because the array [ages()]
has not been defined. Thus SAS thinks it is a function. This is a common
problem: one error causes a cascade of error messages later in the code.
Normally if you can see and correct one error, it\'s worthwhile to run
the program again before spending any significant time trying to figure
out any subsequent errors. They may take care of themselves.

### Endless Quotes or Comments

SAS uses quotes\--single or double\--to mark off text that should be
treated in a special way. If the end quote is missing, SAS will get very
confused. Consider the following:

set \'whh;

Note the missing single quote at the end of the file name. In the log
you\'d see that SAS got to this point, and then the entire rest of the
program will be printed to the log without any indication SAS tried to
execute it. Finally, you\'ll see SAS complaining that it\'s not seeing
what it\'s expecting and that it can\'t open a data set.

The problem is that without an end quote, SAS thinks the entire rest of
the program is the file name for the input data set. And since it still
doesn\'t end with a quote and a semicolon, you finally get an error
message at the end of the program.

A related problem can occur with comments. SAS will ignore any text in
between [/\*] and [\*/]. This allows you to
write explanatory notes for yourself or others that read your code\--a
very good idea. However, if you forget the [\*/] at the end,
the rest of your program will be ignored completely.

TextPad and Emacs with ESS make it easy to catch these kinds of errors
because they put strings in quotes and comments in distinctive colors.
If half your program suddenly turns \"comment green\" that\'s a good
indication that you forgot to end a comment somewhere in the middle of
it.

### Typos

Obviously any typos in your code may cause problems. It\'s not as
guaranteed as you might think:

dat long;

will actually get you:

WARNING 14-169: Assuming the symbol DATA was misspelled as dat.

As long as SAS is correct, this is good. Obviously there are limits:

da long;

gets you:

    4          da long;
               __
               180

    ERROR 180-322: Statement is not valid or it is used out of proper order.

    5           set 'whh';
                ___
                180

    ERROR 180-322: Statement is not valid or it is used out of proper order.

    6           keep hhinc hhid age sex;
                ____
                180


    ERROR 180-322: Statement is not valid or it is used out of proper order.

Note the cascading failure again here. Because SAS doesn\'t realize
you\'re starting a data step here, all the data step commands don\'t
make sense. Change [da] to [data], and all the
rest will go away.

Once again, syntax coloring can help you here. If you\'re trying to type
a SAS command and it doesn\'t turn \"command blue,\" you know there\'s a
problem.

You can run into more subtle problems if you mistype a variable. SAS
does not have any special syntax to create a variable. It is placed in
the PDV as soon as you mention it in the code. For example, if you
accidentally type

keep hhinc hhid age srx;

where [srx] is meant to be [sex], the code still
runs. The only indication of trouble is a warning in the log:

    WARNING: The variable srx in the DROP, KEEP, or RENAME list    has never been referenced.

Then when you try to use [sex] later, in your second data
step, you get

    NOTE: Variable sex is uninitialized.

It was supposed to come from the results of the first data set, but it
was dropped because it wasn\'t on the list of variables to keep. But a
warning or a note doesn\'t stop your program from running. It will
proceed and do what SAS thinks you intended. But the results will be
nonsense. This demonstrates the importance of looking carefully at your
log even if the program ran to completion and gave you the output you
expected.

## Learning More

You now have a good background in how data steps work, but there\'s much
more to learn. The SSCC has a variety of articles on specific topics in
SAS\--take a look at our [Knowledge Base](home.htm).

For a broad but somewhat shallow introduction to SAS, The Little SAS
Book by Delwiche and Slaughter is the standard, and is available in the
CDE library. The SAS online documentation of course can tell you
everything you need to know, but it can be a challenge to read.

Finally, the SSCC Help Desk will be happy to answer any questions you
may have about SAS. From 1-4 every afternoon the consultant on call will
be someone familiar with SAS. But you can [email the Help
Desk](mailto:helpdesk@ssc.wisc.edu) or call 262-9917 at any time and
your question will be referred to the person who can best answer it.
